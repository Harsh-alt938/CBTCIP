# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This is a Python implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game, where the player competes against the computer. The game is built using the Tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface (GUI).

## How to Play

1. The game window will prompt you to enter your name.
2. Click on the corresponding button to make your choice: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
3. The computer will randomly choose one of the three options.
4. The game will determine the winner based on the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules:
  - Rock beats Scissors
  - Paper beats Rock
  - Scissors beats Paper
5. The result (win, lose, or tie) will be displayed, and the scores will be updated.
6. The game history will show the last five rounds, displaying the choices made by the player and the computer, along with the result.
7. You can continue playing as many rounds as desired.
8. To exit the game, click on the "Exit" button.
